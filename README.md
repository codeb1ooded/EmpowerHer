# EmpowerHer++
#### (Inspired by goals of tech communities like Systers in a unique way)


### Problem statement
We went to ACM-ICPC regionals
In about 400 participants there were not even 10 girls while there are women in women hackathons!!
Why???

We tried to identify the root cause of problem. 
Why it becomes difficult to reach out to all girls??
We present a solution which empowers them to come out of their shell with the comfort of their home, school or university.
We motivate & aware them to seek help and join other tech communities like Systers, Women Techmakers, etc.


### Solution
#### Awareness & Scattered Resources: 
A single place to learn about all the opportunities in tech and remain informed!!

#### Unable to find Mentors:
To find a mentor in tech and that too for a specific type of advice is never easy. We make it easy for you. Get personalized help from people who love to help!!

#### Unidentified Questions:
Sometimes, they donâ€™t know what to ask and then whom to ask. With question-answer feature, get your questions answered.

#### Been there, done that!!
Seeing someone achieve something, it gets you motivated to achieve that. With this thought, people who already attended a particular event can share their experiences. It also helps girls, to understand the various unsaid things about those events.

#### Expand Tech Circles: 
Platform gives freedom to talk to people and hence expand your circle. Also, find teammates for upcoming events.

#### Get Identified: 
With your contribution to platform and community in terms of answering questions, sharing your experiences and guiding others, you earn reputation and badges in the community. Bust the bubble of Imposter Syndrome.

#### More women in tech:
Tech is considered to be male-dominated but when girls will get identified, the notion will change and they would no more feel like I am not made for Tech!!
